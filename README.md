## About Me

I bridge **laboratory precision** and **machine learning rigor** — moving from 3 years managing clinical lab data to building interpretable AI models for medical imaging. I specialize in making black-box models explainable for high-stakes decisions in **healthcare and regulated industries**.

My work focuses on the intersection of **model performance** and **model transparency**, ensuring that AI systems are not only accurate but also auditable and trustworthy in safety-critical applications.

**Currently working on:**
- Interpretable ML models for lung cancer CT screening (96.7% accuracy with GRAD-CAM explainability)
- NLP benchmark dataset: 50K+ automotive listings across 8 text domains (AutoTrader UK collaboration)
- Data pipeline reproducibility and PySpark automation for clinical research workflows
